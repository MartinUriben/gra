			<h2>Cuban Sandwich</h2>
			
		<p>Crispy, golden, and packed with bold flavor, the Cuban sandwich is a timeless favorite born from Cuban-American culture. This hearty pressed sandwich layers tender, juicy roast pork, sweet ham, melty Swiss cheese, tangy pickles, and zesty yellow mustard between slices of buttery Cuban bread. Grilled to perfection, each bite delivers the perfect balance of savory, salty, and tangy flavors with a satisfying crunch. Whether you're serving it for lunch, dinner, or a weekend get-together, this iconic sandwich brings big flavor with minimal fuss.</p>
